# Web3 Trading Team – Data Science Assignment  
**Candidate:** Akarshit Singh
# Trading Sentiment Analysis Project

## Objective
Analyze trading sentiment and Profit & Loss patterns to generate actionable insights for traders.  
The project provides a comprehensive report combining EDA, visualizations, and findings to understand trading behavior.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple CSV files covering trading data, including:

- Trade ID: Unique identifier for each trade
- Date: Date of the trade
- Sentiment: Positive, Neutral, or Negative
- PnL: Profit or Loss of the trade
- Volume: Number of units traded
- Asset Type: Type of asset (stocks, options, etc.)

All CSV files were merged, cleaned, and preprocessed to create a single consolidated dataset for analysis.

## Project Structure
`ds_akarshitsingh/`
- csv_files/      # Original CSV data files
- outputs/        # EDA plots and visualizations
- notebooks/      # Jupyter / Colab notebooks used for analysis
- ds_report.pdf   # Final report including EDA, insights, and conclusion
- README.md       # Project summary

## Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Removed duplicates  
   - Corrected data types  
   - Treated outliers  

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Generated visualizations for sentiment, PnL, and trade patterns  
   - Plotted distributions and correlations  

3. Insights & Findings  
   - Positive sentiment dominates trades  
   - Profitable trades are more common in positive sentiment  
   - Patterns guide actionable strategies  

4. Report Generation  
   - Created a professional PDF report (`ds_report.pdf`)  
   - Included title page, sections, EDA plots, insights, and conclusions
     
## Submission (exactly as required)
- Root folder: `ds_akarshitsingh` ✓
